IP Address Tracker
The IP Address Tracker is a responsive web application that tracks IP addresses and domains, displaying detailed location information on an interactive map. This application combines multiple APIs and technologies to solve real-world geolocation problems where users can automatically detect their current location or search for any IP address or domain to see where it's located geographically. The application provides comprehensive information including the IP address, location details such as city, region, and postal code, timezone with UTC offset, and ISP information, all visualized on an interactive map with custom markers. The project has been deployed using Netlify for live demonstration and public accessibility.

What This Application Does
With the IP Address Tracker you can automatically detect your current IP location through real-time tracking that displays your location on page load. You can search any IP address like 8.8.8.8 or domain names like google.com to look up specific locations. The application provides interactive location data through visual display using Leaflet.js mapping with custom markers. You can access detailed geolocation information to see IP address, city and region location, timezone, and Internet Service Provider details. The responsive design works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Users receive helpful feedback through user-friendly error messages and loading states that guide you through the process. The application benefits from fallback systems that use browser geolocation when available and automatically fall back to IP-based location detection.

Technologies and Tools Used
The IP Address Tracker utilizes HTML5 for semantic markup structure that ensures accessibility and proper document organization. CSS3 provides responsive design with CSS custom properties and modern styling techniques. JavaScript ES6+ enables modern async/await patterns, ES6 modules, and comprehensive DOM manipulation. Leaflet.js serves as the interactive mapping library for location visualization. The IPify API acts as a third-party service for detecting user's public IP address. Geo.ipify.org API provides geolocation data service for IP address and domain lookup. OpenStreetMap functions as the map tile provider for the interactive map display. Netlify serves as the cloud platform used for deployment and hosting of the live application.

Application Structure
The ip-tracker directory contains index.html as the main HTML document with semantic structure, and styles.css for CSS styles and responsive design rules. The src folder includes script.js for main JavaScript application logic and API integration, plus secrets.js for API key configuration that is excluded from the repository. The images folder contains favicon-32x32.png for browser tabs, icon-arrow.svg for the search button arrow icon, pattern-bg-mobile.png for mobile device backgrounds, and pattern-bg-desktop.png for desktop display backgrounds. README.md provides project documentation and setup instructions.

Setup and Installation Process
Before starting you need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. You also need an API key from geo.ipify.org where a free tier is available, plus a local web server for development using  Node.js or similar tools.
To install the application you download or clone the project files using git clone followed by navigating to the ip-tracker directory. You obtain your API key by creating an account at geo.ipify.org, then navigating to your dashboard and copying your API key. You configure the secrets file by creating src/secrets.js and adding your actual API key. You secure your API key by adding src/secrets.js to your .gitignore file.

Configuration and Security
The application requires a valid API key from geo.ipify.org and you must create a src/secrets.js file with your actual API key from geo.ipify.org. Important security practices include never committing your API key to version control systems and always adding src/secrets.js to your .gitignore file. For production deployments you should use environment variables or secure key management services and monitor your API usage to prevent exceeding rate limits.
For development and testing purposes you can use example values by uncommenting lines in script.js for testing. You can use 8.8.8.8 as Google's public DNS server or www.google.com as a popular domain for testing functionality.

How to Use the Application
The application automatically detects and displays your current IP location when the page loads. It uses browser geolocation API when permissions are granted and falls back to IP-based location detection if geolocation fails. For manual search functionality you enter any IP address such as 8.8.8.8 or domain name such as google.com in the search field. You click the search button or press Enter to initiate the lookup and view the results displayed on the interactive map and information panel.
The information provided includes the IP Address showing the actual IP address being tracked and analyzed. Location Details show city, region or state, and postal code when available. Timezone Information displays UTC offset for the geographical location. ISP Information shows Internet Service Provider details and organization data.

Customization Options
For styling and theme customization the application uses CSS custom properties for easy theme modification. You can modify values like --color-primary-dark-grey: hsl(0,0%,17%), --color-primary-gray: hsl(0,0%, 59%), --font-size-body: 1.125rem, and --spacing-md: 2rem to customize the visual design.
For map configuration settings you customize the interactive map behavior in script.js. You can modify default map view and zoom level using map = L.map("map").setView([0,0], 2). You can adjust geolocation zoom levels with map.locate({setView: true, maxZoom: 16}). You can customize marker appearance and size using const customIcon = L.divIcon with className: "custom-marker", iconSize: [46, 56], and iconAnchor: [23, 56].

API Integration Details
The application integrates with IP Address Lookup at https://geo.ipify.org/api/v2/country,city?apiKey={key}&ipAddress={ip} for specific IP tracking. Domain Lookup uses https://geo.ipify.org/api/v2/country,city?apiKey={key}&domain={domain} for domain name resolution. User IP Detection utilizes https://api.ipify.org?format=json for automatic IP discovery.

Error Handling and User Experience
The application includes comprehensive error handling for invalid or missing API keys, network connection failures, invalid IP address or domain formats, API rate limiting and service unavailability, geolocation permission denials, and map initialization and rendering failures.

Browser Support and Compatibility
Supported browsers include modern desktop browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge in their latest versions. Mobile browsers including iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, and Samsung Internet are also supported. Technical requirements include ES6+ JavaScript support, Fetch API compatibility, and CSS Grid compatibility.

Project Reflection:

The IP Address Tracker is a responsive web application that tracks IP addresses and domains, displaying detailed location information on an interactive map. This project combines multiple APIs and technologies to create something that solves real-world problems - you can automatically detect your current location or search for any IP address or domain to see where it's located geographically. The application provides comprehensive information, including the IP address, location details, timezone, and ISP information, all visualized on an interactive map with custom markers.

What Clicked for Me
The biggest breakthrough was understanding how asynchronous JavaScript works in practice. Reading about promises and async/await is one thing, but chaining API calls - first getting the user's IP, then fetching location data, then updating the map - made it click. I also got comfortable with ES6 modules, which initially seemed unnecessarily complex but now feel essential for organizing code properly.
Working with external APIs taught me that documentation isn't always perfect, and debugging network requests is crucial. The Leaflet mapping library was surprisingly intuitive once I understood the basic concepts of layers, markers, and coordinate systems. Learning to create responsive layouts using CSS Grid and implementing proper error handling strategies helped me understand what makes applications feel professional rather than just functional.

The Reality of Debugging and Getting Help
I spent way too much time on silly syntax errors. Missing brackets, typos in variable names, and forgetting to close functions. These weren't conceptual problems but pure carelessness that brought everything to a halt. Learning to use browser dev tools effectively and checking the console first became second nature.

When I hit walls,  my instructors Abraham E. Taverez and Colton Wright were invaluable in helping our cohort work through complex integration challenges. Their guidance on API key management and security practices felt like stepping into "real" development practices. Equally important was the support from my fellow classmates, whether they were helping debug tricky issues or just serving as a sounding board when I needed to vent frustration and regroup. That collaborative environment made tackling difficult problems feel manageable rather than overwhelming.
